// Deprecated lowercase card module left for compatibility.
// Use `Card.tsx` (capitalized) as the canonical component.

// This placeholder intentionally exports nothing so that older lowercase
// import paths don't cause module resolution errors on case-insensitive
// file systems. Consumers should import from `./ui/Card`.
